# üß† **Machine Learning Pipeline for Dataset Analysis and Model Tuning**

## üåü What is it?

This project implements a complete **machine-learning pipeline** for dataset analysis, feature selection, and model tuning. It covers:
- **Dataset Cloning and Preprocessing**: Loading, formatting, and explaining data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding dataset behavior and variance.
- **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using multiple classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors, MLP, etc., with extensive tuning using `GridSearchCV`.
- **Feature Importance and Selection**: Employing techniques such as RandomForest, Lasso, and SHAP to rank features by importance.

## üéØ Why did we do it?

In machine learning, it's essential to:
- **Understand and preprocess data** effectively before model building.
- **Optimize models** through hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best possible performance.
- **Select important features** to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

This project provides a pipeline to automate these tasks, helping you save time and improve performance when dealing with machine learning problems.

- **Pipeline Execution**: The project loads datasets, preprocesses them, and runs multiple classification models using optimized hyperparameters.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the data variance and behavior using PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE.
- **Feature Importance**: Displays the importance of various features using multiple algorithms, helping to focus on key features.
- **Model Performance**: Classification accuracy, confusion matrices, and feature selection results are all provided.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How did we do it?

### 1. **Dataset Cloning & Loading**:
   - Cloned a dataset from a GitHub repository and used `npz` files to load the training and test datasets.

### 2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explored data through PCA and visualized cumulative variance.
   - Applied dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and UMAP to understand data behavior.
   - Clustered data using K-Means and calculated metrics such as entropy and silhouette scores.

### 3. **Feature Selection**:
   - **RandomForest, Lasso, SelectKBest, and SHAP** were used to identify the most important features for model training.
   - Combined the top features from each method to create a powerful feature subset.

### 4. **Model Tuning**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed for various classifiers (MLP, KNN) using `GridSearchCV`.
   - Optimized models were evaluated on test data and compared for accuracy.

## üìò What did we learn?

- **Data Understanding**: How to use PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for better insights into high-dimensional data.
- **Feature Selection**: The importance of using multiple techniques to select robust features.
